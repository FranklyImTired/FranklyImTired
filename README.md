- 👋 Hi, I’m @FranklyImTired
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything? Does everything count? Can I say that? I would personally argue that I don't really know quite enough to really specify what I'm interested in the most.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code from the ground up using The Odin Project. I did a tiny bit of coding in school, but it wasn't very much and also not very helpful. So, I'm a complete beginner. Yay me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know, actually. I'm open to suggestions though.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Does GitHub have direct messaging as a feature? 'Cause I genuinely don't know. I'm new. Sue me. (Please don't, actually) I do have both an instagram and a discord account, but I would prefer not to disclose those so publicly.
